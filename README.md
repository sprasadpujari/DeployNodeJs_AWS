Welcome to our step-by-step guide on deploying the DeployNodeJs_AWS project! Whether you're a beginner or someone unfamiliar with technical jargon, we've crafted this guide to make the process easy to follow.

Whenever you have start any project ,Please make sure your project is running successfully in locally .

**Testing the Project Locally**
* Clone the Project

**Now lets start Set Up an AWS EC2 Instance**
* Create an IAM User
  1.Log in to your AWS Console.
  2.Create a new IAM user with access type "Password" and permissions set to "Admin".
* Create an EC2 Instance
  1.Launch a new EC2 instance with the following configurations:
  2.OS Image: Ubuntu
  3.Key Pair: Create a new key pair and download the .pem file
  4.Instance Type: t2.micro

* Connect to the Instance Using SSH
  Once connected, update the system and install some necessary tools:
  ssh -i instance.pem ubuntu@<IP_ADDRESS>

* Elastic IP Address Setup
  For this project, you'll need an Elastic IP Address for your EC2 instance. This will act as your project's domain.

* Initialise and Start the Project on Remote VM
  Back in the terminal, run these commands:
